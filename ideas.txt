features of nvimnotes

- can read the yaml at the top of the page to open the right PDF
- start taking notes on the pdf with ":Annotate"
    - if there's no yaml with a pdf name, have to pass an argument
    - maybe allow for multiple notes in the same document?
    - use H1 (#) (or user-specified format) to choose the file that :Annotate will
    open (use the one most recently backwards)
- maybe a way to change the format of the slide headers through vimrc settings?
    - let the user specify a string with "%d" in it which will be used to insert
    the slide number
- assume that we're going with the md format

## Slide {num}

- notes

## Slide {num + 1}

- notes


If you are on a slide in the pdf, should be able to start taking notes with a
shortcut (i.e. :NewNote)

Should also be able to be on a page, and start taking notes on the next page
:NextNote
- if there's a note for the next page, will just go to the end of the note for
that page
- if there isn't a note for the next page, will create it (with the header)
- just inserts lines, doesn't change lines (this is possible, right? reference the
:AddSubNumber)
- same thing for :PrevNote -- if no previous note, will create it (inserting
lines, not changing lines), if exists, will go to it
- also, changing the note with this will also change the PDF position
- checks to see if that page in the PDF exists before doing anything!

- also want to control the PDF without moving in the notes
- use :PrevPage and :NextPage
- this means that the notes will get out of sync with the pdf
- use :SyncPage to sync the pdf with the location of the cursor in the notes
- use :SyncNotes to sync the notes with the position of the notes (i.e. current
note page)
